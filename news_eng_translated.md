"**Mobile World Congress 2025 Kicks Off in Barcelona, Showcasing Samsung’s Galaxy S25 and AI Innovations**

The world’s largest mobile technology exhibition, *Mobile World Congress 2025 (MWC25)*, officially kicked off on the 3rd (local time) in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung Electronics took center stage with its Galaxy S25 series, unveiling interactive experience zones and introducing groundbreaking AI-powered mobile experiences and next-generation network technologies that drew significant attention from visitors.

With over 110,000 attendees expected this year, downtown Barcelona was buzzing with excitement even before the event’s opening. Massive advertisements highlighting the Galaxy S25 series dominated the landscape around the exhibition venue. Amid surging anticipation for AI innovation, the Samsung exhibition hall quickly became a global focal point — and the Samsung Newsroom was there to explore it firsthand.


### A True AI Phone: Galaxy S25 Brings a New Mobile Experience

At the Fira Gran Via exhibition center, Samsung constructed a 1,745㎡ (528 pyeong) exhibition hall designed to showcase the evolved mobile experience of the Galaxy S25 series and its vision for the future. A massive 41-meter-wide LED screen captured visitors’ attention, displaying powerful visuals that conveyed the innovation and ambition behind Galaxy AI.

Visitors were invited into interactive zones spotlighting the Galaxy S25’s advanced AI capabilities, pro-grade camera experiences, and enhanced gaming performance. Attendees could receive personalized information powered by on-device AI, explore smart photo capture and editing features, and experience seamless, high-performance mobile gaming firsthand.


### Personalized Health and a Smarter, Safer Home with AI

Samsung also introduced a ‘Health Solution’ zone, presenting AI-driven personalized wellness tools, and a ‘Home Solution’ zone, where users could explore a smarter and more secure connected home environment powered by SmartThings and Knox Matrix.

In the Health Solution zone, features from Samsung Health helped users manage their well-being with ease. A standout function was **Now Brief**, which provides users with personalized morning updates. By checking their **Energy Score**, users could assess their sleep quality from the night before and gauge their physical readiness for the day ahead. The sleep details page offered deep insights into sleep duration, stages, and blood oxygen levels. Additionally, a comprehensive environmental report analyzed room brightness, temperature, and humidity to offer suggestions for improving sleep quality.

One visitor, after experiencing the personalized health management flow, remarked, “Galaxy AI is truly redefining the paradigm of personal health care.”

In the Home Solution zone, Samsung showcased a smarter living experience backed by SmartThings and its secure Knox Matrix system. Visitors explored features such as a 3D Map View on the Galaxy Tab S10, which visualized connected devices on a home floor plan and allowed users to control them directly. Smart routines that automate devices based on user preferences, fall detection alerts, and daily activity notifications for family members were also on display. Additionally, AI-powered tools analyzed energy consumption to support smarter, more sustainable energy use.

Knox Matrix played a key role in securing these connected experiences. Through its multi-layered protection, devices could independently monitor for threats and alert users in real time — ensuring a safe and seamless smart home ecosystem.


### Galaxy’s Commitment to Security and Sustainability

Samsung further emphasized the Galaxy series’ robust security and sustainability efforts. Galaxy users can control how their data is processed — choosing between on-device or cloud-based AI processing. On-device AI, powered by the **Personal Data Engine (PDE)** and protected by **Knox Vault**, ensures sensitive data stays private and secure.

Sustainability was another major theme. Samsung highlighted its innovative battery recycling process used in the Galaxy S25 series, which repurposes cobalt from discarded batteries to create new ones. The company also unveiled **Ocean Mode**, a feature specially developed for capturing vibrant underwater footage of coral reefs — part of a broader initiative to support marine conservation. Additionally, Samsung showcased how discarded fishing nets are repurposed into key smartphone components, underscoring its commitment to eco-conscious innovation.


### AI-Powered Next-Gen Network Solutions

In a separate exhibition space, Samsung spotlighted its latest network innovations based on AI and software — offering a glimpse into the future of mobile communications.

Targeting global B2B clients such as telecom providers, Samsung introduced a range of next-generation network technologies. The **Samsung CognitiV Network Operations Suite** automates the full spectrum of network installation, operation, and optimization using AI, while the **AI Energy Saving Manager** analyzes traffic patterns to reduce energy consumption by up to 35% without compromising network quality.

Other highlights included the industry’s first application of **5G RedCap (Reduced Capability)** technology in mass vehicle production — developed in collaboration with Hyundai Motor Company — along with a new lineup of high-performance network chipsets and various base station solutions.

### Looking Ahead

Throughout the duration of MWC25, Samsung’s booth is expected to be packed with visitors eager to experience the latest mobile and network innovations. By continuing to lead in AI-driven user experiences and next-generation connectivity, Samsung aims to strengthen its role at the forefront of the mobile ecosystem.
